Self written set of components to create basic apps with views and store

# Add a View
1. Create a new view file `myComponent.view.js` and store it in the views folder.
2. Add your new view component to `views.config.js`.
3. Add a new cript tag to the `index.html` view file.
4. Refresh and you have one more view.

No worries for your navigation because its renderd there too based on the `views.config.js` file.
